# Basic inspections of Data

I want to know how many rows are in my data using r

First here is my data
```{r start}
prDat <- read.table("GSE4051_MINI.tsv", header = TRUE, row.names = 1)
```

Next I subset the data of only rows that have a poisonFang value of greater than 7.5
```{r sub}
weeDat <- subset(prDat,poisonFang > 7.5) # observations with poisonFang over 7.5

nrow(weeDat) # number of rows with poisonFang over 7.5

```

Now I want to subset sample 16 and 38 with only the colums of gene expression

``` {r sub2}

new <- prDat[c("Sample_16", "Sample_38"), c("crabHammer", "eggBomb","poisonFang")]
```
